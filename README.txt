  - generators (folder) - This folder contains a Python source file for each implemented generator. 
                          It also contains a file called "__init__.py" which allows the files to be 
                          imported into other python programs.
  - diagnostics.ipynb   - This is a Python notebook that can be run with a runtime such as Jupyter, 
                          or within a code editor like Visual Studio Code. This code performs the
                          graphical diagnostics and statistical tests, and produces related 
                          visualizations.
  - runtime.ipynb       - This is a Python notebook that may be run in the same manner as the 
                          diagnostics code. This code performs runtime data collection.
  - .gitignore          - This file is a list of file names that should not be checked in to git
                          source control.
